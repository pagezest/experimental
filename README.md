Proof of Concepts for PageZest, a new CMS written in Rust.

Goals are:
- Use max of 10 MB of RAM, preferably targeting 5 MB of RAM in low-loads (max 5 requests per second, which is laughably Wordpress's limit).
- Secure, sandboxed plugins using WebAssembly.

We will build in public. We will publish blog posts and new proofs of concepts.
